1. we need check the pointer for msg and code is not null.
	in the run_length_encode function:
		 if (msg == NULL || code == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

2.when we doing the for loop, the size can be either check or not, is size <= 0, the for loop will not continue. 

3. after the 0, we need to get an integer bigger than 3. 
	in the run_length_decode function:
	if (i + 1 >= size || code[i+1] < 3) {
                printf("there is an error in the RLE decode process, abort");
                return -1;
            }

4. we need to check the length of the code. also when we excute the msg, the length of the msg need also be get in.
